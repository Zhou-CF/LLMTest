{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.8.11.2'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.8.11.2\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address '2.8.11.2' is hardcoded in the code, it means that the application will always use this specific IP address, which can cause issues if there are changes in the network configuration or if the IP address is no longer valid. Additionally, if the IP address is exposed to public repositories or shared with others, it could pose a security risk as it can be easily modified or intercepted by unauthorized individuals."}}
