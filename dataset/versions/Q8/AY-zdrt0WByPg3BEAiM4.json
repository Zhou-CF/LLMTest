{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.8.11.2'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.8.11.2\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address '2.8.11.2' is hardcoded in the code, it means that the application will always use this specific IP address, which can pose a security risk if the IP address changes or if there are multiple possible IP addresses for a service. Hardcoding IP addresses can also make it difficult to manage the application across different environments or when trying to scale it up or out."}}
