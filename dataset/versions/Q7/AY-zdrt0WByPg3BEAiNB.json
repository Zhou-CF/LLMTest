{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.9.10.1'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is hardcoded in the code, it becomes difficult to change it in the future without modifying the source code. Additionally, if the IP address is exposed to external sources, it could pose a security vulnerability, as attackers could attempt to target that specific IP address. Therefore, it is generally safer to use dynamic IP addresses or resolve them through configuration files or environment variables."}}
