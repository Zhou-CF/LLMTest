{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.8.11.2'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.8.11.2\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address '2.8.11.2' is hardcoded in the code, it means that the application will always use this specific IP address, which can cause issues if there are changes in the network configuration or if the IP address is no longer valid. Additionally, if the IP address is exposed in the code, it can pose a security risk as it can be easily accessible to anyone who has access to the code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches. Therefore, it is generally recommended to avoid hardcoding IP addresses and instead use dynamic methods or configuration files to manage them."}}
