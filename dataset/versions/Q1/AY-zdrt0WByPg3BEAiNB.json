{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.9.10.1'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is hardcoded in the code, it means that any change in the IP address would require changing the code and redeploying the application. This can become a challenge during maintenance or if the application needs to be scaled or migrated to a different environment. Additionally, if the IP address is exposed to external sources, it could become a potential target for attackers. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use dynamic methods to retrieve IP addresses or store them securely in configuration files or environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the code."}}
