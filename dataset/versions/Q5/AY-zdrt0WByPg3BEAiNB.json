{"基本信息": {"HighLightCode": "'2.9.10.1'", "Message": "Make sure using this hardcoded IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is safe here.", "risk": "Hardcoding IP addresses is security-sensitive"}, "回答情况": {"是否有风险": "是", "理由": "Hardcoding IP addresses in code is generally not considered a good practice because it makes the application less flexible and more prone to security risks. If the IP address \"2.9.10.1\" is hardcoded in the code, it means that any change in the IP address will require modifying the code, which can be error-prone and time-consuming. Additionally, if the IP address is exposed to external sources, it can be a security vulnerability, as attackers could attempt to target that specific IP address. Therefore, it is generally safer to use dynamic IP addresses or retrieve them from configuration files or environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the code."}}
